<p>Bellas Biograohy</p>
<p>I am 17 years old. I am a junior at Antigua International School. I was born in Los angeles, California and moved to Guatemala when i was 13 years old. I enjoy practicing yoga, hiking, shoppping and memorizing the countrys and capitals of the world. My favorite movie is either clueless or the grand budapest hotel. Pink is my favorite color. I would consider myself a feminist, enviormentalist and someone who seeks change in theyre community.</p>
